Task:  
1. Classify the main industry of this company using a standard category if possible (NAICS, SIC, or a short description).  
2. Estimate where AI (automation, analytics, generative AI, vision, etc.) could help this company.  
3. Estimate how much proprietary/business data the company likely has.  
4. Rate how valuable Euphemystic Ventures’ OpenSearch consulting would be for them.  
5. Estimate how likely it is that the company already has AI initiatives underway (0 = very unlikely, 5 = definitely already underway).  
6. **Compute AFI**:  
   • Estimate head-count and revenue (use revenue-per-employee benchmarks if revenue is unknown).  
   • Use a default marketing-spend assumption of 7.7 % of revenue (or an industry-specific % if known).  
   • Assume 12 % of the marketing pool is discretionary for research/pilots.  
   • `afi_score = (revenue × marketing_% × 0.12) ÷ 4000`.  
   • Assign `afi_band` based on the score and state the key driver(s) in `afi_reason`.  
7. Return the required JSON only, including **all** company facts and the AFI metrics for a complete record.  
8. If any information is missing, proceed with what is available.
